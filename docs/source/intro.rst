   Introduction


.. admonition:: Backgroud & Mission

   The Fusion-Oriented Open Dataset (FOOD) represents a strategic initiative by `ISIF`_ and `CSIF`_ to advance the field of autonomous systems. Developed by the `Smart Sensor Fusion Laboratory`_. The primary mission of FOOD is to construct a foundational data infrastructure explicitly designed for multi-source information fusion. It aims to resolve the scarcity of high-quality, synchronized, and structurally aligned data required for advanced autonomous systems.


.. admonition:: Key Characteristics 

   To support the evolution of next-generation intelligent agents, FOOD provides a robust verification platform with full-spectrum coverage:

   * **Unified Data Representation**: Distinct from traditional datasets that maintain isolated data sturcture for different sensors, FOOD abstracts heterogeneous sensor data into a standardized, fusion-oriented representation. This architectural design breaks down the barriers between modalities, significantly reducing the complexity of multi-source alignment and processing.

   * **Sensor-Agnostic Adaptability**: Thanks to this unified design, the dataset possesses inherent universality. It is capable of adapting to virtually all sensor types (Lidar, Radar, Camera, etc.) within a consistent framework. This allows researchers to focus on algorithm design rather than data parsing and format conversion.

   * **Methodological Inclusivity**: The unified architecture naturally facilitates fusion across all layers. By standardizing data at the fundamental level, FOOD supports multi-level fusion algorithms more efficiently and intuitively than datasets relying on loose coupling of raw logs.

.. .. admonition:: Goals

..    The SDC project serves the following purposes:
   
..    #. Description of the setup of sensors, equipment, data center and code repositories;
   #. Establishment of proper data sets to support researchers at SJTU;
   #. Design of systematic use cases for algorithm test/component verification and validation;
   #. Facilitation of our research on fusion and related metrices framework topics.
